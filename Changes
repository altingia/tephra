Revision history for Tephra

Version	Date	Location
0.02.6	04/22/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix with LTR-RT exemplar IDs causing issues with generating the LTR exemplar files.

0.02.5	04/21/16	Vancouver, BC

- When classifying LTR-RT families, skip transposase domain matches to avoid artifacts in the family assignment.
- Bug fix in 'findhelitrons' command that was writing the coordinates in the wrong order for elements
  on the minus strand.
- Bug fix in the 'make_exemplars' method for the LTR-RT classification, which was writing empty files.
- Standardize IDs with other methods when creating LTR-RT exemplars.
- Add debug option for 'findhelitrons' command to optionally show external commands.

0.02.4	04/07/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add method to standarize FASTA identifiers between GFF and FASTA files for the classifyltrs command.
- Write the element name to the output file of the ltrage command instead of the tree file name. Now the FASTA
  identifier from the combined families file will be written to the ltrage output.
- Add LTR family name to GFF output of classifyltrs command.
- Remove the generation of separate GFF files for each LTR superfamily as this information can be easily
  taken from the annotated GFF file.
- Bug fix for --clean method of ltrage method. A class attribute was missing for this option so it would have
  never worked previously.
- Disable building GUI apps for EMBOSS, which are not used internally.
- Add Perl import for configuration (Net::FTP) which is not available in core for older Perls.

0.02.3	04/04/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for getting URL of deps from sourceforge (which has changed).

0.02.2	  03/17/16    Vancouver, BC

- Fix GO term IDs modified incorrectly during version change.
- Add HMMERv3 to configuration to avoid version issues (HMMERv3 from package manager is too old)
  and to simplify installation for the user.

0.02.1	03/17/16	Vancouver, BC

- Changes to fix threading issue with ltrage command.

0.02	03/15/16	Vancouver, BC

- Improve annotation of unclassifed LTR elements.
- Add option for installation/configuration in any location.
- Add configuration for 'findltrs' command to facilitate finding elements in a broader number of species.
- Add sighandler for BLAST processes.
- Add separate Install/Config classes for easily getting configuration information.
- Add options for controlling the thresholds of matches when annotation LTR elements.
- Add debug option for seeing the external commands that were executed.
- Add 'development' option for skipping long-running commands that require software that I cannot distribute.
- Set up Travis-CI for automated testing. This works efficiently because we are now using pre-built binaries and a pre-configured
  Tephra root directory.

- Add option for substitution rate for ltrage command.
- Add multiple options for controlling the stringency of matches that are counted as real for the sololtrs command.
- Add output of a single collated report from ltrage command instead of individual reports for each element.
- Change input for findnonltrs command from directory of individual sequences to the more convenient multi-FASTA format.

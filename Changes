Revision history for Tephra

Version	Date	Location

- Increase BLAST+ package version.
- Simplify install instructions to use latest release only.

0.03.5	07/28/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add reannotate command for transferring annotations from a reference set to Tephra annotations.
- Fix minor issue with help command not being recognized with main tephra command. 

0.03.4	07/06/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for formatting output of illrecomb command (fixes #16 on github).
- Refactor illrecomb methods to not write intermediate files.
- Add method to clean up intermediate results from findnonltrs command.
- Adjust muscle command for sololtr and illrecomb commands to not throw away errors. 

0.03.3	06/24/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for ltrage command. The wrong arguments to muscle were introduced in changes for v0.03.2, which
  has been updated.

0.03.2	06/21/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix in setting the wrong repeat_region ID for elements when evaluating overlaps (fixes #15 on github).
- Bug fix for parsing Helitron IDs from final FASTA file. A minimal parser (no dependencies) was added to the class 
  to account for Bio::DB::HTS::Kseq not parsing anything past the first whitespace. 
- Remove use of clustalw2 everywhere in favor of muscle. This solves a couple of issues, as clustalw2 was quite noisy and
  error-prone when compiling from source.
- Increase default number of matches to consider in LTR family clustering/classification in an arbitrarily large number.
  This will keep families from split based on the size in case there is an unusually large number of matches.

0.03.1	06/09/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add --all option to 'ltrage' command for calculating age of all LTR-RTs in a GFF
  instead of just the default exemplars. This makes getting the age a bit easier now
  by just requiring one command as opposed to one for each superfamily.

0.03.0	06/08/16	Vancouver, BC

- Remove use of SAMtools for indexing/extracting subsequences.
- Remove use of Bio::SeqIO (BioPerl) for parsing sequence files.
- Add Bio::DB::HTS for extracting subsequences and parsing sequences.
- Fix bugs in getting TIR element range (previously off by 1).
- Rework solo-LTR search to look for exemplars and extract LTR features of all
  elements if they are not found. This avoids duplicating work done in the exemplar-finding step.
- Add test file of exemplars to speed up testing (also, no exemplars would be found in
  the small test set)
- Remove use of Bio::Tools::GFF (BioPerl) in favor of Bio::GFF3::LowLevel for parsing GFF features. 
  This is a made a huge performance improvement, as well as simplifying how features would be formatted
  for writing.
- Add strand to non-LTR output (GFF).
- Add the same transposase filtering method to all steps of LTR classification.
- Adjust gap filtering step in non-LTR search to filter elements only in the final stage of classification.

0.02.7	05/06/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix with HMMERv2 path not being set correctly for 'findnonltrs' command.
- Add threshold for percent of Ns in non-LTR-RTs.
- Bug fix to get --help and --man options working correctly.
- Add method to remove leading or trailing gap sequences in 'findnonltrs' command.
- Expand list of transposase-related models to filter prior to LTR family classification.

0.02.6	04/26/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix with LTR-RT exemplar IDs causing issues with generating the LTR exemplar files.
- Bug fix in LTR-RT refinement step to check that elements exist before trying to summarize features.
- Remove used method for getting TE SO terms (added to the 'Util' role to be used by other classes).

0.02.5	04/21/16	Vancouver, BC

- When classifying LTR-RT families, skip transposase domain matches to avoid artifacts in the family assignment.
- Bug fix in 'findhelitrons' command that was writing the coordinates in the wrong order for elements
  on the minus strand.
- Bug fix in the 'make_exemplars' method for the LTR-RT classification, which was writing empty files.
- Standardize IDs with other methods when creating LTR-RT exemplars.
- Add debug option for 'findhelitrons' command to optionally show external commands.

0.02.4	04/07/16	Vancouver, BC

- Add method to standarize FASTA identifiers between GFF and FASTA files for the classifyltrs command.
- Write the element name to the output file of the ltrage command instead of the tree file name. Now the FASTA
  identifier from the combined families file will be written to the ltrage output.
- Add LTR family name to GFF output of classifyltrs command.
- Remove the generation of separate GFF files for each LTR superfamily as this information can be easily
  taken from the annotated GFF file.
- Bug fix for --clean method of ltrage method. A class attribute was missing for this option so it would have
  never worked previously.
- Disable building GUI apps for EMBOSS, which are not used internally.
- Add Perl import for configuration (Net::FTP) which is not available in core for older Perls.

0.02.3	04/04/16	Vancouver, BC

- Bug fix for getting URL of deps from sourceforge (which has changed).

0.02.2	  03/17/16    Vancouver, BC

- Fix GO term IDs modified incorrectly during version change.
- Add HMMERv3 to configuration to avoid version issues (HMMERv3 from package manager is too old)
  and to simplify installation for the user.

0.02.1	03/17/16	Vancouver, BC

- Changes to fix threading issue with ltrage command.

0.02	03/15/16	Vancouver, BC

- Improve annotation of unclassifed LTR elements.
- Add option for installation/configuration in any location.
- Add configuration for 'findltrs' command to facilitate finding elements in a broader number of species.
- Add sighandler for BLAST processes.
- Add separate Install/Config classes for easily getting configuration information.
- Add options for controlling the thresholds of matches when annotation LTR elements.
- Add debug option for seeing the external commands that were executed.
- Add 'development' option for skipping long-running commands that require software that I cannot distribute.
- Set up Travis-CI for automated testing. This works efficiently because we are now using pre-built binaries and a pre-configured
  Tephra root directory.

- Add option for substitution rate for ltrage command.
- Add multiple options for controlling the stringency of matches that are counted as real for the sololtrs command.
- Add output of a single collated report from ltrage command instead of individual reports for each element.
- Change input for findnonltrs command from directory of individual sequences to the more convenient multi-FASTA format.

0.01	12/24/15	Vancouver, BC

- Initial release.

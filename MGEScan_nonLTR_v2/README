Installation
===============

To install MGEScan-nonLTR, follow the steps below:

1. Go to http://darwin.informatics.indiana.edu/cgi-bin/evolution/nonltr/nonltr.pl to find
the "Software" on the left bottom of the page.

2. Click "Software" to download the program.

3. Untar the downloaded file "MGEScan_nonLTR.tar". This will automatically generate the
directory "MGEScan_nonLTR".
Command: tar -xvf MGEScan_nonLTR.tar

4. Install HMMER package and add the path of "hmmsearch" in your shell file such as
.bashrc. To make sure that "hmmsearch" is accessible by our program, type "hmmsearch" in
the directories "MGEScan_nonLTR".

5. Install EMBOSS package and add the path of "transeq" in your shell file such as
.bashrc. To make sure that "transeq" is accessible by our program, type "transeq" in
the directories "MGEScan_nonLTR".

6. Make sure you have a Perl Interpreter and C compiler such as g++.

7. Run "makefile" to compile "translate" and "MGEScan".
       - In the  MGEScan_nonLTR directory
         Command: make clean
         Command: make translate
       - In the MGEScan_nonLTR/hmm directory
         Command: make clean
         Command: make MGEScan

Running the program
====================

To run MGEScan-nonLTR, follow the steps below:

1. Put genome files in a directory. You can put them in any directory since you will
specify the directory when you run the program.

2. Run run_MGEScane.pl. This perl script reads your genome files and runs the whole
process. You can type the following commands in a line. You need three parameters (genome
directory, output data directory, program directory for MGEScan-nonLTR). Using full paths
such as "/home/Workshop/software/MGEScan-nonLTR/" is required.

command: ./run_MGEScan.pl genome=[directory that has genomes] -data=[directory where the 
	 output will be saved] -program=[directory that has all the files of MGEScan-nonLTR]

Example: ./run_MGEScan.pl -genome=/data/MGEScan_nonLTR_v2/example/seq/ 
          -data=/data/MGEScan_nonLTR_v2/example/data/  -program=/data/MGEScan_nonLTR_v2/

Output
============
Upon completion, MGEScan-nonLTR generates the directory, "info" in the data directory you
specified. In this "info" directory, two sub-directories ("full" and "validation") are
generated.

- The "full" directory is for storing sequences of elements. Each subdirectory in "full" 
is the name of clade. In each directory of clade, the DNA sequences of nonLTRs identified
are listed. Each sequence is in fasta format. The header contains the position
information of TEs identified:
[genome_file_name]_[start position in the sequence]
For example, >chr1_333 means that this element start at 333bp in the "chr1" file.
- The "validation" directory is for storing Q values. In the files "en" and "rt", the
first column corresponds to the element name and the last column Q value.

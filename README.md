Transposable Element Paleontology by Historical Reconstruction from Annotations

### What is Tephra?

Tephra is a command line application to annotate [transposable elements](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposable_element) from a genome assembly. The goal is to provide a high quality set of de novo annotations for all transposon types, describe the structucture and evolution of those sequences, and do it without a reference set of transposon sequences (therefore being unbiased as possible)..

**SUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION**

You can get usage information at the command line with the following command:

    perldoc tephra

The `tephra` program will also print a diagnostic help message when executed with no arguments.

- compare domain organization in LTRs to what is expected per superfamily; incorporate this into the classification scheme
- remove duplication filter because these may represent fragmented alignments (make optional) DONE
- re-evaluate transposase filtering DONE
- clean up logs and intermediate files from vmatch (dbluster-*)
- reporting of superfamilies after ltr search?.. better to do that at classification stage
- combine domain organization from both strands (if the same)?
- check for index (if given) with findltrs cmd
- change header format to be ">id_source_range"

- reduce LTRs/TRIMs....perhaps when combining all GFFs
- logging results/progress
- documentation

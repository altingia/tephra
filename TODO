-- classifyltrs
- compare domain organization in LTRs to what is expected per superfamily; incorporate this into the classification scheme
- clean up logs and intermediate files from vmatch (dbluster-*)
- combine domain organization from both strands (if the same)?

-- findtirs
- check for index (if given)

-- classifytirs
- in tests, skip if empty output (none found). This is not a good test honestly, need a new reference

-- findltrs 
- check for index (if given)
- change header format to be ">id_source_range"
- adjust filtering command to not increment if element has been deleted (inflated filtering stats)
- reporting of superfamilies after ltr search?.. better to do that at classification stage
- add options for LTR size parameters

-- ltrage
- make subs. rate a class attribute / option

-- findnonltrs
- break chromosomes to reduce memory usage in hmmsearch
- check HMMER2 var and program version
- remove backticks and shell exec of hmmer
- remove nasty regex in favor or bioperl reading of report
- use list form of system to not fork
- run domain searches in parallel
- use multiple CPUs (make option) for domain searches
- write GFF of results

-- meta
- logging results/progress
- documentation
- reduce LTRs/TRIMs....perhaps when combining all GFFs
- save tnp matching ltr-rts and search for cacta tes..or just add as putative classII

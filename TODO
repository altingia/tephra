-- classifyltrs
- compare domain organization in LTRs to what is expected per superfamily; incorporate this into the classification scheme
- clean up logs and intermediate files from vmatch (dbluster-*)
- combine domain organization from both strands (if the same)?

-- findltrs 
- check for index (if given) with findltrs cmd
- change header format to be ">id_source_range"
- adjust filtering command to not increment if element has been deleted (inflated filtering stats)
- reporting of superfamilies after ltr search?.. better to do that at classification stage

-- meta
- logging results/progress
- documentation
- reduce LTRs/TRIMs....perhaps when combining all GFFs
